# IngotOS
A work in progress small (very small) kernel made entirely in Assembly. Made for learning purposes, it's supposed to display a bright blue screen, and print, "You did it you crazy son of a bitch!" It will then hang. However, once this is accomplished, I will expand the OS into something more usable.
